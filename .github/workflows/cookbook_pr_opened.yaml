            This repository caches data generated from notebooks stored in other
            repositories in the `_cookbook_data` branch. Regenerating this cache
            takes about half an hour, so it is not done automatically in PRs.
            The current value of the cache from the `main` branch has been
            copied over to this PR's cache.


            To regenerate the cache for this PR, create a comment on this PR
            consisting only of the string:


            ```

            /regenerate-cache
            
            ```
